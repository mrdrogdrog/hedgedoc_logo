# HedgeDoc-Logo: Cody

Hi,

I want to show you some of my drafts.
They all involve "Cody". That's my WIP name for the little hedgehog you'll see.

So let's introduce Cody:
![3_1|690x196](export/cody_color_blackborder.png)
![6_1|690x197](export/cody_color_whiteborder.png)
![7_1|690x197](export/cody_transparentborder.png)

Cute little guy, right? How about a black/white or white/black version? Okay!

![2_1|690x197](export/cody_wb.png)

The last logo was a document icon. So what about putting Cody into a document?

You want to see Cody with a pencil? Got you covered!

You want to see a neon magenta/purple Cody on a document with a pencil-surfboard and 80s sunglasses?.. *searching* Okay, I haven't created this version yet, but if you want to see any combination or variant, then I can create and post it!

Sure these drafts aren't perfect, but if you like any of them, i'm gonna do my best to make them (nearly) perfect.

All logos are made from scratch with :heart: and inkscape.

Hope you like it! :)
