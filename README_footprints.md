# HedgeDoc-Logo: Cody

Hi,

My second draft is a visualisation of an idea a good friend of mine had.

It's the old logo but with hedgehog footprints on it:
![5_1|690x197](export/hedgehog_footprints_document.png)

Sure these drafts aren't perfect, but if you like any of them, i'm gonna do my best to make them (nearly) perfect.

All logos are made from scratch with :heart: and inkscape.

Hope you like it!
